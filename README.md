## Cognitive biases

### The mind is an operating system
- It has multiple processes always running in the background, it can‚Äôt always work perfectly

### Too much information
- Anchoring ( relying too much on first impressions)
- Confirmation bias (searching for info to confirm your theory)
- Choice-supportive bias (prioritising what makes you happy/what you know)

### Not enough meaning
- Authority bias (person of authority , so must be correct rather than trusting your own instinct)
- Bandwagon effect (going with what everyone else is doing)
- Outcome bias (judge situation on outcome rather than decision)

### Exploiting bias in the workplace

- Reactance - by telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
- Reciprocity - be the first to give
    - The feeling of obligation to give when you receive
    - Personalised and unexpected makes it even better
- Door in the face - forcing people to refuse a larger request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
- Likability - give compliments and build co-operation
    - Freely give honest flattery
- The bystander effect - people look to others to determine their own actions
